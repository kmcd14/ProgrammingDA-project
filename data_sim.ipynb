    "The real world phenomenon topic I have chosen for this project is the supposed home advantage in sports. The reason I have chosen this as my topic is because as an avid sports fan and that  I certainly noticed a difference in the impact having no spectators has had on sporting events during the Covid-19 pandemic, where fans were unable to enter grounds.  It certainly seemed that the sports phenomena of having the upper hand over your opponent when the game is being played on your own turf was neutralised. \n",

This means that the home team plays in familiar surroundings, has the vast majority of fans in the stadium and does not have to travel to a different ground. On the other hand, the away team has to travel, has to deal with rowdy home support, in some cases adjusting to different climates and/or time zones and the possibility of referring to bias - “Fergie-time” anyone?."
