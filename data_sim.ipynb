Some of the advantages for the home team are; football pitches have a minimum and maximum dimensions that they can be, meaning size of pitches vary, some stadiums have fans closer to the pitch than others and different pitches have different playing surfaces [9]. I know my home team - Dundalk F.C - are the only team in the League of Ireland whose home pitch is artificial, it is often a contentious issue where opponents complain about it. The ball bounces and moves differently and faster on an artificial surface than on real grass. This is often seen as giving Dundalk an unfair advantage when playing at home as they are used to it. "
